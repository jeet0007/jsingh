## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Installation options

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/netlify-templates/next-netlify-starter.git`
2. Navigate to the directory and run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Make your changes
5. Connect to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/Bk4UicocL) manually (the `netlify.toml` file is the one you'll need to make sure stays intact to make sure the export is done and pointed to the right stuff)

## Testing

### Included Default Testing

We’ve included some tooling that helps us maintain these templates. This template currently uses:

- [Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/) - to regularly update our dependencies
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - to run tests against how the template runs in the browser
- [Cypress Netlify Build Plugin](https://github.com/cypress-io/netlify-plugin-cypress) - to run our tests during our build process

If your team is not interested in this tooling, you can remove them with ease!
